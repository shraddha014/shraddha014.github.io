            >With 3.5 years of experience in software engineering, I have honed
            my skills across both frontend and backend development, working with
            technologies like Java and Angular. My journey began at a startup
            where I was responsible for building and managing a hiring-focused
            website. This role provided a foundation in full-stack development
            and project management. Following this, I joined Accolite Digital as
            a software engineer intern. After six months of intensive learning
            and contribution, I transitioned into a full-time role, and by
            August 2023, I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer. In this
            capacity, I have led and contributed to critical projects, including
            the ACARS and Flight Planning System, showcasing my ability to
            handle complex systems and deliver impactful solutions.</span
